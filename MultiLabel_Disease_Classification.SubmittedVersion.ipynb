    "## Vectorization of Words (Word Embedding)\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) systems traditionally treat words as discrete atomic symbols. For example, ‘tiger’ may be represented as “W1” and 'cat' as “W2”. These encodings are arbitrary and provide no useful information regarding the relationships that may exist between the individual symbols. Representing words as unique, discrete symbols furthermore leads to data sparsity, and usually means that we may need more data in order to successfully train statistical models. Using vector representations can overcome some of these obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want these vectors to be created in such a way that they somehow represent the word and its context, meaning, and semantics. For example, we’d like the vectors for the words ‘tiger’ and ‘cat’ to reside in relatively the same area in the vector space when compared to ‘car’ since they’re both animals of the same family of species (viz., ‘Felidae’). The vector representation of a word is also known as a word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create these “word embedding” (i.e. vector representation of words), we will use the famous “Word2Vec” model instead of reinventing the wheel. The Word2Vec model is created by Google – one of the biggest players in the ML game and was trained on a massive Google News dataset that contained over 100 billion different words."
